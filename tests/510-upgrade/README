verify bs-update's actions: new version, tarball

this test asserts bs-update's behavior in the case where
the user wants to upgrade the package using a new tarball.

this is done by replacing all commands used in the CUT with
cooked functions, these write their invocations to a "tape"
which is then compared with a canonical "tape".
