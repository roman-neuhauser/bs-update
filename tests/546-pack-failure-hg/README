verify bs-update's actions: tarball creation fails

`bs-update -d .` uses `hg archive` to create the tarball.

this test has two purposes: verify that the constructed
command line meets expectations, and make sure bs-update
does not go on after failure in this step.  actual hg
failing would lead to some verbiage on stderr, this test
doesn't care about that.
