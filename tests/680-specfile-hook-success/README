aborts if bsu_specfile_hook exists and succeeds

this test asserts bs-update's behavior in the case where
bsu_specfile_hook exists and succeeds.

this is done by replacing all commands used in the CUT with
cooked functions, these write their invocations to a "tape"
which is then compared with a canonical "tape".
