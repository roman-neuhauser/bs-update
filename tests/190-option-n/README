option -n causes bs-update to report values and exit

- stdout should report the final values gleaned from
  .bs-update (if any) and command line arguments;
  this test uses no .bs-update, focusing on command
  line handling
- stderr should be empty
- exit code should be 0

the -d option-argument in this test is written to keep
an eye on variable substitution
