verify bs-update's actions: update_tarball fails

this test asserts bs-update's behavior in the case where
osc fails while updating the tarball for whatever reason:
bs-update should stop there.

this specific test has the "osc rm old-tarball" command fail;
i want to see that update_tarball returns right there, without
going on with the remaining code.

actual osc failing would lead to some verbiage on stderr,
this test doesn't care about that, just makes sure bs-update
does not go on after this step failing.

this is done by replacing all commands used in the CUT with
cooked functions, these write their invocations to a "tape"
which is then compared with a canonical "tape".
