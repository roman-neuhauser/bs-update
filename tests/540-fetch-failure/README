verify bs-update's actions: tarball download fails

this test asserts bs-update's behavior in the case where
the tarball download fails for whatever reason: bs-update
should stop there.

actual wget failing would lead to some verbiage on stderr,
this test doesn't care about that, just makes sure bs-update
does not go on after this step failing.

this is done by replacing all commands used in the CUT with
cooked functions, these write their invocations to a "tape"
which is then compared with a canonical "tape".
