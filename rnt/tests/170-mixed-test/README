partially failing test case run

if stdout, stderr or exit code does not match expectations,
run-test.sh should output a concatenation of the test's README
file and diffs of *.{expected,actual} file pairs.
stderr should be empty, and the exitcode should be non-zero.

this test excercises failing err, exit diffs; stdout matches
expectation.  out.diff, out.diff.tmp should be gone
afterwards, .diff, .diff.tmp files for the other facets
should be kept.  all .actual files should be kept.
